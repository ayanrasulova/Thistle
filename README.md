## Inspiration:

Generative AI has become more powerful over the last few years, and a lot of discourse within art communities involves the idea that artists with disabilities are not able to create art without the use of generating drawings through prompt engineering. As passionate artists and software developers, we wanted to challenge this notion, offering an accessible alternative for digital drawing beyond the constraints of a mouse, tablet, or physical device. 

## Features:

Thistle utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe Hands to detect and track hand signals through a live webcam feed. Our custom motion-mapping algorithms classify specific hand gestures, including: 

- index finger (‚òùÔ∏è) to navigate through the canvas
- dual fingers (ü§ò) to switch between drawing and erasing mode 
- index finger with thumb out (üëÜ) to interact with the canvas (drawing or erasing)
- finger pinch (‚òùÔ∏è) to enter color selection mode 
- long swipe (üñêÔ∏è) to clear the canvas 

These gestures are then transmitted in real-time via webcam to our JavaScript canvas, rendering the canvas on our front-end website (build with React and Tailwind).

## How To Use!

Make sure you install the dependencies first:
``` bash
pip install dependencies.txt
```

If you are on Linux, make sure you create a virtual environment for your dependencies:
```bash 
sudo apt install python3-full python3-venv -y
python3 -m venv ~/venv
source ~/venv/bin/activate
pip install dependencies.txt
```
If your imports are not working, make sure you change your interpreter on your IDE to match your virtual environment. 

Then, type the following commands into the terminal: 
 ```bash
# include steps here
```

## Reflection/Next Steps:

We have centered our design with consideration to those with Parkinson's, Dyspraxia, and carpal tunnel syndrome. However, we plan to allow for customization with our computer vision mappings, allowing people to map canvas interactions to kinesthetic movements that feel most comfortable for them.
