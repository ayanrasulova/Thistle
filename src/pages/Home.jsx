                            Generative AI has become more powerful over the last few years, and a lot of discourse 
                            within art communities involves the idea that artists with disabilities are not able to 
                            create art without the use of generating drawings through prompt engineering. As passionate 
                            artists and software developers, we wanted to challenge this notion, offering an accessible 
                            alternative for digital drawing beyond the constraints of a mouse, tablet, or physical device.
